# Fashion-App-AI
Users will snap simple photos of the clothes they buy, and the app will organize these items into a personalized virtual closet. Each piece is automatically tagged by the app with key details like type, season, color, and style. Users can also add custom tags, such as “oversized,” “winter wear,” or “formal,” for further personalization.

When it’s time to dress up, users simply open the app and describe what they’re in the mood for—like “oversized style” or “casual chic.” The AI analyzes their virtual closet and recommends outfits by matching items they already own to create the perfect look.

Our goal is to simplify outfit planning, inspire creativity, and maximize the use of existing wardrobes. We need a UX Designer who can craft an intuitive, visually appealing, and seamless user experience, ensuring every interaction feels effortless and engaging.
--------------------------------
To create an AI-powered app that enables users to snap photos of clothes, organize them into a personalized virtual closet, and recommend outfits based on user preferences, we'll need several key components:

    Computer Vision Model: To automatically analyze and tag clothing items based on their photos (e.g., type, season, color, style).
    Personalized Recommendation System: To suggest outfits based on the user’s mood or preferences.
    User Interface (UI/UX): To provide a smooth and engaging experience for the user to interact with their virtual closet.

Key Functionalities:

    Image Processing: Classify clothing items using computer vision models.
    Outfit Recommendations: Match items in the user's wardrobe to suggest outfits based on certain criteria.
    Custom Tags: Allow users to add tags to items, making it easier to filter and categorize clothing.
    Intuitive UI: Provide a simple way for users to interact with the app and make wardrobe decisions.

Here’s an outline of the Python code for such an app, leveraging TensorFlow for the image processing model, Pandas for data management, and a simple recommendation system. We'll focus on the backend logic that could power the app.
1. Install the Necessary Libraries

pip install tensorflow pillow pandas numpy opencv-python scikit-learn

2. Load and Train the Image Classification Model

This is the first step, where the AI will classify images of clothing into categories like type, season, color, and style.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd

# Load pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2 or a custom model trained for clothing classification)
model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Define your custom classifier (you can fine-tune this model or use transfer learning on it)
def preprocess_image(img_path):
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(img_array)
    return np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

def classify_clothing(img_path):
    processed_image = preprocess_image(img_path)
    prediction = model.predict(processed_image)
    return prediction

# Example usage:
# Assuming a file named 'shirt.jpg' in the current directory
img_path = "shirt.jpg"
prediction = classify_clothing(img_path)
print(prediction)

3. Organizing Clothes in the Virtual Closet (Data Structure)

The app will organize clothes into a database-like structure. Each clothing item will be tagged with key attributes like type, season, color, and custom tags.

class VirtualCloset:
    def __init__(self):
        self.closet = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Item", "Type", "Color", "Season", "Style", "Tags"])

    def add_item(self, item_name, item_type, color, season, style, tags=None):
        tags = tags or []
        item_data = {
            "Item": item_name,
            "Type": item_type,
            "Color": color,
            "Season": season,
            "Style": style,
            "Tags": tags
        }
        self.closet = self.closet.append(item_data, ignore_index=True)

    def get_item(self, item_name):
        return self.closet[self.closet["Item"] == item_name]

    def list_items(self):
        return self.closet

    def recommend_outfit(self, mood_tags):
        matching_items = self.closet[self.closet["Tags"].apply(lambda x: any(tag in x for tag in mood_tags))]
        return matching_items

# Example usage:
closet = VirtualCloset()
closet.add_item("Blue Shirt", "Top", "Blue", "Winter", "Casual", ["oversized", "casual"])
closet.add_item("Black Jeans", "Bottom", "Black", "Winter", "Casual", ["formal"])

# Get a list of items
print(closet.list_items())

# Recommend outfit based on mood (e.g., "casual" or "oversized")
print(closet.recommend_outfit(["casual"]))

4. Outfit Recommendation System

The recommendation system matches clothing items based on the user's preferred style, season, or mood.

def recommend_outfit_based_on_mood(mood, closet_data):
    # Filter items based on tags
    recommended_items = closet_data[closet_data["Tags"].apply(lambda x: any(tag in x for tag in mood))]
    
    if recommended_items.empty:
        print("No items found for your mood.")
        return None
    else:
        return recommended_items.sample(n=2)  # Recommend 2 random items for the outfit

# Example of recommending an outfit for a user:
user_mood = ["casual", "winter"]
recommended_outfit = recommend_outfit_based_on_mood(user_mood, closet.closet)
print("Recommended Outfit:\n", recommended_outfit)

5. Building the User Interface (UI/UX)

For the app’s front-end, we will use a framework like Flask (for web-based apps) or Kivy (for mobile apps) to provide the user interface.

Here’s a basic outline using Flask to create a simple web interface.

pip install flask

Simple Flask Web App Example:

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Assuming we have the VirtualCloset class defined earlier
closet = VirtualCloset()

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html', closet=closet.list_items())

@app.route('/add_item', methods=["POST"])
def add_item():
    item_name = request.form["item_name"]
    item_type = request.form["item_type"]
    color = request.form["color"]
    season = request.form["season"]
    style = request.form["style"]
    tags = request.form["tags"].split(",")  # Split tags by comma
    closet.add_item(item_name, item_type, color, season, style, tags)
    return jsonify({"message": "Item added successfully!"})

@app.route('/recommend', methods=["GET"])
def recommend():
    mood = request.args.get("mood").split(",")
    recommended_outfit = recommend_outfit_based_on_mood(mood, closet.closet)
    return render_template('recommend.html', recommended_outfit=recommended_outfit)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

6. Deployment and Expansion

    Backend: You can deploy the backend system using services like Heroku or AWS.
    Mobile App: For mobile, you could use frameworks like React Native or Flutter to create a cross-platform app.
    AI Model: Use models like ResNet, Inception, or custom-trained models for clothing classification, ensuring that images are processed correctly.
    Cloud Storage: Store user photos in the cloud (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to prevent large file storage in the local database.

7. Future Enhancements

    Real-Time Outfit Suggestions: Integrate live weather data to adjust recommendations based on current weather conditions.
    Personalization with Deep Learning: Train models on the user’s preferences over time to improve outfit recommendations.
    Virtual Try-On: Integrate AR-based virtual try-on features where users can see how outfits look on them before trying them physically.

Conclusion:

This code outlines the essential backend logic for a virtual closet app using AI and machine learning to help users organize their wardrobes and recommend outfits based on mood or preferences. By combining computer vision, recommendation algorithms, and a user-friendly interface, the app can enhance user experience and simplify daily dressing decisions.
